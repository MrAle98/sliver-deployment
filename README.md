# sliver-deployment

This repo contains automation scripts in order to deploy my own branch (**branch refactor/teamserver-interaction**) of sliver having P2P communications over beacons, along with a builder (**branch cppimplant** able to build C++ sliver implants for windows platform. Source code available of C++ implants is available here: https://github.com/MrAle98/Sliver-CPPImplant2. Probably can teach how to **NOT** write software in C++. The implant code is compatible only with the branch **refactor/teamserver-interaction** as It changes the way the implant interacts with the server in order to support P2P communications over beacons.

This repository deploys both a **sliver teamserver** and a **builder of C++ implants for the windows machine**. The **teamserver** is deployed on **linux machine**, the **builder** is deployed on a **windows machine**.

## Deploy all locally

Here instructions about how to deploy the **teamserver** on a **local kali VM** and the **builder** on a **local windows VM**.
